<p>Given Microsoft's decision to steadily <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/06/22/azure-active-directory-is-the-future-of-acs.aspx" target="_blank">migrate the capabilities</a> of ACS (Access Control Service) into WAAD (Active Directory), it can be confusing to new users trying to determine when they should be using each service. I'm hoping to clarify that by breaking down the differences between each.</p>
