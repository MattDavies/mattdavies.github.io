title: React Native - From Zero To Continuous Delivery - Getting Started
---

It doesn't take long for any discussion about mobile app development to lead to [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). If you haven't heard of it, React Native is a way to build mobile applications purely using JavaScript. Unlikely a hybrid app, we end up with a truly native mobile application with awesome performance, a development experience which includes seeing live updates on your screen seconds after you save a file, and the truly exciting ability to push out native application changes in minutes to your users in production.

In this blog series, I'll cover setting up a React Native app, some tips to help you avoid common pitfalls and be productive quickly, and walk you through setting up an automated continuous delivery pipeline including a test and production version of your application.

----------

1. **Getting started - setting up your application**
2. Making your life easier - a fast development workflow
3. Automated testing - setting our level of release confidence
4. Plugins - maximising value and avoiding pitfalls
5. Styling your app without the frustration
6. Debugging, logging, profiling and avoiding some common issues
7. Code Push - rapidly pushing out most updates without binary changes
8. Fastlane - automating certificates and provisioning profiles
9. Fastlane - automatically pushing binaries to the App and Play Store
