<p>I've been making heavy use of <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/web-sites/" target="_blank">Windows Azure Websites</a> to migrate some legacy applications to Azure lately, and ran into an interesting issue around deployments that I thought I'd share my solution to.</p>
<p>One of the simple websites has two environments - a development and production site, implemented as two unique Websites within the Azure Portal.</p>
<p>The source control for the website is a private <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> repository, linked using the Portal. For the development environment, that's fine - I'm happy for it to be continuously deployed each time I push a new commit. For the production environment, I obviously don't want that to happen!</p>
<p>I decided on a few rules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
